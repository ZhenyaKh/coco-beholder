# CoCo-Beholder: Testing Congestion Control Schemes

All the CoCo-Beholder tools were tested to work properly with Python 2.7, 3.5, 
3.6, and 3.7. CoCo-Beholder installation script `install.sh` installs Python 2
library dependencies by default. In this script, there are also commented out
lines enabling the installation of the dependencies for Python 3 and the 
installation of the exact versions of the dependencies, if needed.

## Installation

The installation process is as following:

* Install Pantheon collection of congestion control schemes and, if needed, 
[add](#adding-a-new-scheme) more schemes to the collection

* Install CoCo-Beholder using its installation script

* Done. [Test](#testing) the schemes in the collection using CoCo-Beholder.

CoCo-Beholder installation scipt `install.sh` is super easy and short. However, 
due to the facts that there are bugs in the operating systems and that some 
schemes fail to get installed properly, the above described installation 
process is not trivial. Please, cosider the detailed instructions for 
[Ubuntu 16.04](#installation-on-ubuntu-1604-lts), 
[Ubuntu 18.04](#installation-on-ubuntu-1804-lts), and
[Debian 10](#installation-on-debian-10).

### Installation on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS

The instructions below were tested on the VM with a fresh install of Ubuntu 
16.04.6-desktop-amd64 (Nov. 2019).

* As a general note: if you need TCP BBRv1.0 scheme make sure to use Linux 
kernels >=4.9.

* Fresh releases of 16.04 LTS (16.04.5 and higher) provide Linux kernel 
4.15 with HWE. The information on Ubuntu kernels and HWE can be found 
[here](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Kernel/LTSEnablementStack). 
CoCo-Beholder [uses](#testing) **tc qdisc netem jitter**, and the feature is 
[broken](https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/1783822) on Ubuntu kernel 4.15. The 
solution:

  * Please, install 4.13 kernel to have the jitter:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install linux-image-4.13.0-39-generic linux-headers-4.13.0-39 \
   linux-headers-4.13.0-39-generic linux-image-extra-4.13.0-39-generic
   ```
  * In file `/etc/default/grub`, comment out the line `GRUB_HIDDEN_TIMEOUT=0` 
  and run the command `$ sudo update-grub`. This will allow you to see Grub menu 
  after the reboot.

  * Reboot and in Grub menu, choose `Advanced options for Ubuntu` and 
  there `Ubuntu, with Linux 4.13.0-39-generic`. Check the running kernel: 
  `$ uname -ar`.

* Download Pantheon git repository and git submodules of the included schemes:

```
git clone https://github.com/StanfordSNR/pantheon.git && cd pantheon
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

* You can skip the installation of Pantheon itself (with  its 
`tools/install_deps.sh` script). You need to install only the schemes.
As explained [here](https://github.com/StanfordSNR/pantheon#dependencies),
use the commands below. If the `--setup` command gives you an error like 
`Command "python setup.py egg_info" failed with error code 1...`, then run 
the command `sudo pip install --upgrade pip` and repeat the `--setup` command.

```
src/experiments/setup.py --install-deps (--all | --schemes "<cc1> <cc2> ...")
src/experiments/setup.py --setup [--all | --schemes "<cc1> <cc2> ..."]
``` 

* Run WebRTC server with the command `src/wrappers/webrtc.py sender 54321`. 
The error `Popen(['node'... OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory` is
repaired with `sudo apt-get install nodejs-legacy`.  Try again (never mind the 
output of the server). To clean up all the Webrtc processes, run 
`sudo pkill -9 -f webrtc` afterwards.

* Download CoCo-Beholder git repository and run its installation script:

```
cd coco-beholder && sudo ./install.sh
```

Now you are ready to [test](#testing) the schemes.

## Testing

## Adding a new scheme

## Dependencies to install
  
- ### [**Pantheon**](https://github.com/StanfordSNR/pantheon)

  **IMPORTANT!**
Before testing the third-party schemes present in Pantheon using the 
Variable-Delay tool, it is crucial not only to install dependencies of the 
schemes using `src/experiments/setup.py --install-deps` command but also to set 
up the schemes using `src/experiments/setup.py --setup` command. Without the 
setup, some schemes can work in a wrong way. For example, the scheme *quic* 
installs necessary certificates into the OS during the setup â€“ without the 
certificates, *quic* traffic will not start to flow between client and server 
due to invalid certificate error. It is enough to run the two commands once on 
a user's machine.
   
  At the same time, there is no need to run `src/experiments/setup.py` 
command (without `--setup`) on every reboot because the Variable-Delay tool 
runs the command for all the schemes to be tested as it is. 
    
- ### [**Mininet**](https://github.com/mininet/mininet)

  The point-to-point topology is built with Mininet. Launching clients and 
servers of schemes, launching tcpdump recording, changing tc qdisc netem 
settings for host interfaces, and etc. is done using Mininet popen API. Mininet 
controllers and switches are _not_ used and so the network is _not_ started up 
in terms of Mininet, as there is no need for it.
